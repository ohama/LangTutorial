<current_state>
Phase 1 (Comments) is COMPLETE and verified. All work done, all tests passing.

Currently between phases — Phase 2 (Strings) has not been started yet.

There are uncommitted generated files from the lexer build (Lexer.fs, Lexer.fsi) and PROJECT.md updates reflecting v2.0 progress.
</current_state>

<completed_work>
**Phase 1: Comments — DONE**

- Plan 01-01: Comment implementation - Done
  - Single-line comments (`//`) implemented
  - Block comments (`(* *)`) implemented
  - Nested comment support with depth tracking
  - Unterminated comment error handling
  - Pattern order correct (comments before operators)

- 12 fslit tests created in `tests/comments/`
- 10 Expecto tests created in `FunLang.Tests/CommentsTests.fs`
- All 22 new tests passing
- All 139 total Expecto tests passing
- All 78 total fslit tests passing
- Verification passed: 5/5 observable truths, 4/4 requirements satisfied
</completed_work>

<remaining_work>
**Phase 1:** None — complete

**v2.0 Milestone remaining:**
- Phase 2: Strings (문자열) - Not started
  - String literals `"hello"`
  - Escape sequences `\n`, `\t`, `\\`, `\"`
  - String concatenation `+`
  - String comparison `=`, `<>`

- Phase 3: REPL (대화형 셸) - Not started
  - Basic read-eval-print loop
  - Environment persistence
  - Error recovery
</remaining_work>

<decisions_made>
**Phase 1 Decisions (recorded in STATE.md):**

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Single-line: `//` (C-style) | Developer familiarity, widely recognized |
| Block: `(* *)` (ML-style) | F# consistency, supports nesting |
| Comments in lexer, not parser | No AST pollution, truly invisible |
| Pattern order: comments before operators | Ensures `//` matches before `/`, `(*` before `(` |
</decisions_made>

None — clean handoff point between phases.

v2.0 milestone adds practical features to the tutorial language:
1. Comments (done) - code documentation
2. Strings (next) - text data type
3. REPL (last) - interactive shell

The "inside-out" pattern was chosen: start with the innermost lexer change (comments), then add a new data type (strings), then finally the outermost shell (REPL).

Phase 2 (Strings) will require changes to:
- Lexer (string literal recognition, escape handling)
- Parser (string expressions)
- Value type (add StringValue case)
- Evaluator (string operations)

Total estimated: ~50-60 LOC across these files.

M .planning/PROJECT.md      # v2.0 milestone info added
M FunLang/Lexer.fs          # Generated from Lexer.fsl (rebuild artifact)

The Lexer.fs/Lexer.fsi changes are regenerated files from building — the source (Lexer.fsl) changes were committed in `d4bbe85 feat(01-01): add comment support to lexer`.

<next_action>
Run `/gsd:plan-phase 2` to plan the Strings phase.

This will:
1. Research string implementation patterns
2. Create a detailed plan for string support
3. Verify the plan before execution

Alternatively, you can commit the PROJECT.md updates first:
```bash
git add .planning/PROJECT.md
git commit -m "docs: update PROJECT.md with v2.0 milestone info"
```
</next_action>
